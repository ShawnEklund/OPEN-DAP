This repository provides instructinos on how to implement the Digital Analytics Program (DAP) on U.S. Navy public websites that utilize SharePoint as the content management system. DAP is a DoD-wide digital strategy directive that uses Google Analytics 360 to collect and analyze public web traffic data. The DAP JavaScript code is required on federal publicly-facing websites per OMB Memo "2016 Policies for Federal Agency Public Websites and Digital Services" found here: https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/sites/default/files/omb/memoranda/2017/m-17-06.pdf

As the Navy agency representative, the Chief of Naval Information (CHINFO) is the lead for Navy access. LCDR Shawn Eklund, the DAP POC, will help you with creating an account to view your statistical data.
